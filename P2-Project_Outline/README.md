## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here

My project plan is to build a web app called "LittleHelp" using C#/.Net. 
This app helps the residents of a subdivision to fetch informations like 
name, contact info and comments about the service providers like 
handymen, plumbers, lawn mowers, babysitters, housekeepers etc. 
The service providers need a valid credentials to enter their details in the LittleHelp DB. 
The residents after they avail the service can enter their feedback. 

The idea for this project came from my own experience. 
When we moved to new subdivision from an apartment complex, 
it was very difficult to find or get info about a trustworthy handyman, housekeepers etc. 
These experiences were the base for my project idea.
